This tool converts [http://mumble.info/snapshot](http://mumble.info/snapshot) to an RSS feed because there is no official news feed.

The atom feed may not be fully standard compliant but it works with tested programs (liferea, Thunderbird, Firefox, Tiny Tiny RSS).

A result of this script can be found at http://files.natenom.com/public/mumble/feed/mumbledownloads.rss.
